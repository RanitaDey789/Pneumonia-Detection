Pneumonia Detection Using ResNet50

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project uses ResNet50, a deep learning model, to classify chest X-ray images as either Normal or Pneumonia-infected. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and preprocessed before training on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using transfer learning.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

We use the Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset from Kaggle:
ðŸ”— Dataset:       https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

The dataset is divided into:

Train: Images used for model training

Validation: Images for hyperparameter tuning

Test: Images for final model evaluation

How to Run ?
well it is a ipynb file so you can just use it in colab or jupyter as you like.

Feel free to use this for educational use :)
